<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy and Guidelines of the Beginners’ Sites</h2>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
The original text and media in the beginners sites should be licensed under
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_content">free and
open source/artwork</a> licences such as
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">the Creative Commons
Attribution licence (CC-by)</a>
or
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative
Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported licence</a>. On the other
hand they may mirror or link to resources under different licences, as long
as their licensing terms allows that, or they acquired permission from the
author to do so.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The sources for the sites (scripts, templates, etc.) should be versioned in
a public-facing and open-source version control repository.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The sites should have some amount of central control and organisation to
maintain their high quality. Otherwise, the choice of a content-management
system does not matter too much.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
It should be easy to find resources in the beginner sites.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The sites should each have a consistent look and feel, a comprehensive
navigation menu, and other navigational aids.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Please make sure the markup is as standards-compliant, as portable and
as clean as possible.
</p>
